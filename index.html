    <h2>Bananas</h2>
    <h3>By Omar Tounsi</h3>

    <p>Bananas are the <strong>best fruit.</strong> 
    They are sweet and easy to eat.
    They are yellow and taste good. 
    There are many things you can make with a banana. 
    You can add them to your toast. 
    You can make bread out of them. 
    You can make pancakes out of them. 
    You can add them to your cereal. 
    You can add them to your oatmeal. 
    <a href="https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/consumer-trends/top-20/">In fact</a>, they are the most sold fruit in the USA. 
    It feels good that I share the same taste in fruit as the majority of the US population, 
    which makes me love bananas even more.</p>

    <h2>Vacations</h2>
    <h3>By Omar Tounsi</h3>

    

    <p>
        Vacations are the best part of life. 
        We spend most of our lives in an office staring at a computer screen so that we can eventually afford a week or two of vacation. 
        The best part of vacation is that you can relax. 
        The worst part of vacation is realizing that every minute you spend in this paradise is one minute closer to your return back to the office. 
        But don't let that get you down. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ocean breeze on your face â€¦ 
        and try not to think about that cold, dark cubicle that's just waiting for you when you return
    </p>
